 We present the difficult challenge of
spotting topics and detecting significant changes in
text paragraphs. Our objective is to recognise major
topics related to a specific part of paragraph, rather
of detecting and tracking events as in the TDT
configuration, focus the detection of major changes
inside an existing event or narrative. Change point
detection approaches have been used in the past to
detect major changes in sensor signals, but they do
not leverage the textual content of textual streams.
In order to construct a time series, we first perform
linguistic preprocessing or gather simple statistics
on the messages in the discussion.
